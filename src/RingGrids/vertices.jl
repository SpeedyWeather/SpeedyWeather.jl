"""$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)
Vertices are defined for every grid point on a ring grid through 4 points: east, south, west, north.
    
    - east: longitude mid-point with the next grid point east
    - south: longitude mid-point between the two closest grid points on one ring to the south
    - west: longitude mid-point with the next grid point west
    - north: longitude mid-point between the two closest grid points on one ring to the north

Example

       o ----- n ------ o

    o --- w --- c --- e --- o

         o ----- s ------ o

with cell center c (the grid point), e, s, w, n the vertices and o the surrounding grid points.
Returns 2xnpoints arrays for east, south, west, north each containing the longitude and latitude of the vertices."""
