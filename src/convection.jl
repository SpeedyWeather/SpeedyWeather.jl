Check whether the convection scheme should be activated in the given atmospheric column.

1. A conditional instability exists when the saturation moist energy (MSS) decreases with
height, that is, there exists an atmospheric level k such that,

    MSS(N) > MSS(k+h)

where N is the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and k+h is the half-level at the lower
boundary of the full level k.

2. When a conditional instability exists, the convection scheme is activated when, either,

    a. the actual moist static energy (MSE) at level N-1 (directly above the PBL) is greater
       than the saturation moist static energy at some half-level k+h,

            MSE(N-1) > MSS(k+h)

    b. the humidity in both the PBL and one layer above exceeds a prescribed threshold,

            Q(N)   > RH_cnv * Qˢᵃᵗ(N)
            Q(N-1) > RH_cnv * Qˢᵃᵗ(N-1)

The top-of-convection (TCN) layer, or cloud-top, is the largest value of k for which
condition 1 is satisfied. The cloud-top layer may be subsequently adjusted upwards by the
large-scale condensation parameterization, which is executed after this one.
