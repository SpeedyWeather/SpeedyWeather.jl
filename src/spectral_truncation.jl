Returns a spectral coefficient matrix `alms_trunc` that is truncated from `alms` to the size (`trunc`+1)^2.
`alms_trunc` only contains those coefficient of `alms` for which m,l <= trunc, and l>=m are zero anyway.
If `trunc` is larger than the implicit truncation in `alms` obtained from its size than `spectral_interpolation`
is automatically called instead, returning `alms_interp`, a coefficient matrix that is larger than `alms`
with padded zero coefficients. Also works with higher dimensional arrays, but truncation is only applied to
the first two dimensions."""
