  abstract = {Abstract In a recent study, Williams introduced a simple modification to the widely used Robert\textendash Asselin (RA) filter for numerical integration. The main purpose of the Robert\textendash Asselin\textendash Williams (RAW) filter is to avoid the undesired numerical damping of the RA filter and to increase the accuracy. In the present paper, the effects of the modification are comprehensively evaluated in the Simplified Parameterizations, Primitive Equation Dynamics (SPEEDY) atmospheric general circulation model. First, the authors search for significant changes in the monthly climatology due to the introduction of the new filter. After testing both at the local level and at the field level, no significant changes are found, which is advantageous in the sense that the new scheme does not require a retuning of the parameterized model physics. Second, the authors examine whether the new filter improves the skill of short- and medium-term forecasts. January 1982 data from the NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis are used to evaluate the forecast skill. Improvements are found in all the model variables (except the relative humidity, which is hardly changed). The improvements increase with lead time and are especially evident in medium-range forecasts (96\textendash 144 h). For example, in tropical surface pressure predictions, 5-day forecasts made using the RAW filter have approximately the same skill as 4-day forecasts made using the RA filter. The results of this work are encouraging for the implementation of the RAW filter in other models currently using the RA filter.},

  abstract = {Numerical solutions of partial differential equations enable a broad range of scientific research. The Dedalus project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation.},

  abstract = {The formulaton of a multi-layer primitive equation model on the sphere is described. The horizontal representation is by means of spherical harmonics, truncated either in the triangular or rhomboidal manner. The time integration is performed using the semi-implicit method in which the linearized gravity wave terms are time averaged and thus the fast moving waves of this type are slowed. For a 5-layer hemispheric model with triangular truncation at wavenumber 21, storage of 38K words is needed and with the time scheme allowing a time-step of 90 minutes, one day's simulation requires 11 seconds of CDC 7600 time. The growth of a baroclinic wave on a simple basic state of differential solid body rotation is exhibited. The errors involved in this case in utilizing the large time-step allowed by the semi-implicit scheme are thoroughly examined by comparing wave amplitudes and phases, conservation properties and gravity wave treatment for different time-steps. These errors are found to be negligible. The conservation properties of the model are in fact extremely good. The vertical finite differencing scheme of Arakawa is studied in the same baroclinic instability simulation. The growth is similar though the conservation of angular momentum is greatly improved. The transform method used in all these integrations allows some aliasing, but this is shown to be negligible.},

Lower-precision numbers can accelerate simulations and are increasingly supported by modern computing hardware. This paper investigates the potential of 16-bit arithmetic when applied within a shallow water model that serves as a medium complexity weather or climate application. There are several 16-bit number formats that can potentially be used (IEEE half precision, BFloat16, posits, integer, and fixed-point). It is evident that a simple change to 16-bit arithmetic will not be possible for complex weather and climate applications as it will degrade model results by intolerable rounding errors that cause a stalling of model dynamics or model instabilities. However, if the posit number format is used as an alternative to the standard floating-point numbers, the model degradation can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, mitigation methods, such as rescaling, reordering, and mixed precision, are available to make model simulations resilient against a precision reduction. If mitigation methods are applied, 16-bit floating-point arithmetic can be used successfully within the shallow water model. The results show the potential of 16-bit formats for at least parts of complex weather and climate models where rounding errors would be entirely masked by initial condition, model, or discretization error.},

Fugaku, currently the world's fastest supercomputer, is based on A64FX microprocessors, which also support the 16-bit low-precision format Float16. We investigate the Float16 performance on A64FX with ShallowWaters.jl, the first fluid circulation model that runs entirely with 16-bit arithmetic. The model implements techniques that address precision and dynamic range issues in 16 bits. The precision-critical time integration is augmented to include compensated summation to minimize rounding errors. Such a compensated time integration is as precise but faster than mixed precision with 16 and 32-bit floats. As subnormals are inefficiently supported on A64FX the very limited range available in Float16 is 6 \texttimes{} 10-5 to 65,504. We develop the analysis-number format Sherlogs.jl to log the arithmetic results during the simulation. The equations in ShallowWaters.jl are then systematically rescaled to fit into Float16, using 97\% of the available representable numbers. Consequently, we benchmark speedups of up to 3.8x on A64FX with Float16. Adding a compensated time integration, speedups reach up to 3.6x. Although ShallowWaters.jl is simplified compared to large Earth-system models, it shares essential algorithms and therefore shows that 16-bit calculations are indeed a competitive way to accelerate Earth-system simulations on available hardware.},

  abstract = {This work describes the formulation and climatology of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, based on a spectral primitive-equation dynamical core and a set of simplified physical parametrization schemes. The parametrization package has been specially designed to work in models with just a few vertical levels, and is based on the same physical principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the art GCMs. The parametrized processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, short-wave and long-wave radiation, surface fluxes and vertical diffusion. In the current configuration, the model (nicknamed SPEEDY, from Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics") has five vertical levels and a spectral truncation at total wave number 30 (T30L5). The top vertical level (crudely) represents the stratosphere, the bottom one the planetary boundary layer. Computationally, SPEEDY requires (at least) one order of magnitude less CPU time than a state-of-the-art GCM at the same horizontal resolution, and is therefore suitable for studies of inter-decadal or inter-centennial variability. Statistics of the model mean state and variability are computed from an ensemble of 41-year simulations forced by observed sea-surface temperatures in the period 1952\textendash 1992. The model mean state is closer to the observed climatology during the (boreal) winter than during summer. In winter (i.e. December to February, DJF), the model underestimates the amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave pattern, particularly in the European-Atlantic sector. Some aspects of the systematic error of SPEEDY are in fact typical of many GCMs, although the error amplitude is stronger than in state-of-the-art models. On the other hand, the global distribution of precipitation in DJF is quite realistic, and compares well with that of more complex GCMs. In summer (June to August), a strong negative bias in the mid-tropospheric temperature generates a Northern Hemisphere circulation with some springtime characteristics. In particular, the position of the Tropical Convergence Zone in the Indian Ocean remains too far south, leading to a deficient simulation of the monsoon circulation over South Asia. The simulated variability during the northern winter is reasonably realistic as far as the spatial distribution is concerned, although some underestimation in the intensity can be found, particularly in the low-frequency range and in the Atlantic sector. The atmospheric response to ENSO events is also weaker than observed, although the spatial patterns of the rainfall and geopotential response in the Pacific sector are in phase with their observed counterparts.
