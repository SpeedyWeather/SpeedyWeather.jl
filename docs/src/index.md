# SpeedyWeather.jl documentation

Welcome to the documentation for [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/milankl/SpeedyWeather.jl) a global
atmospheric circulation model with simple parametrizations to represent physical processes such as clouds,
precipitation and radiation. SpeedyWeather in general is more a library than just a model as it exposes
most of its internal functions to the user such that simulations and analysis can be interactively
combined. Its user interface is built in a very modular way such that new components can be easily
defined and integrated into SpeedyWeather.

## Overview

SpeedyWeather.jl is uses a spherical harmonic transform to simulate
the general circulation of the atmosphere using a vorticity-divergence formulation,
a semi-implicit time integration and simple parameterizations to represent various
climate processes: Radiation, clouds, precipitation, surface fluxes, among others.

SpeedyWeather.jl defines 
- [`BarotropicModel`](@ref barotropic_vorticity_model) for the 2D barotropic vorticity equation
- [`ShallowWaterModel`](@ref shallow_water_model) for the 2D shallow water equations
- [`PrimitiveDryModel`](@ref primitive_equation_model) for the 3D primitive equations without humidity
- [`PrimitiveWetModel`](@ref primitive_equation_model) for the 3D primitive equations with humidity

and solves these equations in spherical coordinates as described in this documentation.
