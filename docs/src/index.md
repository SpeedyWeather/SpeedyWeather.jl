# SpeedyWeather.jl documentation

Welcome to the documentation for [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/milankl/SpeedyWeather.jl) a global
atmospheric circulation model with simple parameterizations to represent physical processes such as clouds,
precipitation and radiation.

## Overview

SpeedyWeather.jl is a spectral model that uses a Fourier and Legendre transform to calculcate tendencies of
the prognostic variables vorticity, divergence, absolute temperature, logarithm of surface pressure and
specific humidity. The time stepping uses a leapfrog scheme with additional filters and a semi-implicit
formulation for gravity waves. The default resolution is T31 (96x48 grid points on a Gaussian grid, about
400km at the Equator) and 8 vertical levels.

Simple parameterizations are used to represent the physical processes convection, large-scale condensation,
clouds, short-wave radiation, long-waves radiation, surface fluxes of momentum and energy, and vertical diffusion.

## Manual outline

See the following pages of the documentation for more details

by Molteni and Kucharski.

## Scope

The focus of SpeedyWeather.jl is to develop a global atmospheric model of intermediate complexity,
that can run at various levels of precision (16, 32 and 64-bit) on different architectures (x86 and ARM,
currently planned, GPUs probably in the future). Additionally, the model is written in an entirely number
format-flexible way, such that any custom number format can be used and Julia will compile to the format
automatically.

## History

SpeedyWeather.jl is a Julia implementation of [SPEEDY](http://users.ictp.it/~kucharsk/speedy-net.html),
which is written in Fortran 77. Sam Hatfield
[translated SPEEDY to Fortran 90](https://github.com/samhatfield/speedy.f90) and started the project to
[port it to Julia](https://github.com/samhatfield/speedy.jl). However, we are making an effort to
overhaul the implementation of the mathematical model behind speedy completely and it is unlikely
that a single line of code survived.

## Installation

SpeedyWeather.jl is not yet registered in the Julia Registry. So at the moment, open Julia's package
manager from the REPL with `]` and `add` the github repository to install SpeedyWeather.jl and all dependencies
```julia
(@v1.7) pkg> add https://github.com/milankl/SpeedyWeather.jl
```
other branches can be installed by adding `#branch_name`, e.g.
`add https://github.com/milankl/SpeedyWeather.jl#branch_name`.

## Developers

SpeedyWeather.jl is currently developed by [Milan Kl√∂wer](https://github.com/milankl) and
[Tom Kipson](https://github.com/tomkimpson), any contributions are always welcome.

## Funding

This project is funded by the European Research Council under Horizon 2020 within the ITHACA project,
grant agreement number 741112.
