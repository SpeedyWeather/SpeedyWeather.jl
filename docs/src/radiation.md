## Uniform cooling

Following Paulius and Garner[^PG06], the uniform cooling of the atmosphere
is defined as 

```math
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \begin{cases} - \tau^{-1}\quad&\text{for}\quad T > T_{min} \\
                                            \frac{T_{strat} - T}{\tau_{strat}} \quad &\text{else.} \end{cases}
```
with ``\tau = 16~h`` resulting in a cooling of -1.5K/day for most of the atmosphere,
except below temperatures of ``T_{min} = 207.5~K`` in the stratosphere where a
relaxation towards ``T_{strat} = 200~K`` with a time scale of ``\tau_{strat} = 5~days``
is present.

## Jeevanjee radiation

Jeevanjee and Zhou [^JZ22] (eq. 2) define a longwave radiative flux ``F`` for atmospheric cooling
as (following Seeley and Wordsworth [^SW23], eq. 1)

```math
\frac{dF}{dT} = α*(T_t - T)
```

The flux ``F`` (in ``W/m^2/K``) is a vertical upward flux between two layers (vertically adjacent)
of temperature difference ``dT``. The change of this flux across layers depends on the temperature
``T`` and is a relaxation term towards a prescribed stratospheric temperature ``T_t = 200~K`` with
a radiative forcing constant ``\alpha = 0.025 W/m^2/K^2``. Two layers of identical temperatures
``T_1 = T_2`` would have no net flux between them, but a layer below at higher temperature would
flux into colder layers above as long as its temperature ``T > T_t``. This flux is applied above
the lowermost layer and above, leaving the surface fluxes unchanged. The uppermost layer is tied
to ``T_t`` through a relaxation at time scale ``\tau = 6~h``

```math
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{T_t - T}{\tau}
```

The flux ``F`` is converted to temperature tendencies at layer ``k`` via

```math
\frac{\partial T_k}{\partial t} = (F_{k+1/2} - F_{k-1/2})\frac{g}{\Delta p c_p}
```

The term in parentheses is the absorbed flux in layer ``k`` of the upward
flux from below at interface ``k+1/2`` (``k`` increases downwards, see
[Vertical coordinates and resolution](@ref) and [Sigma coordinates](@ref)).
``\Delta p = p_{k+1/2} - p_{k-1/2}`` is the pressure thickness of layer ``k``,
gravity ``g`` and heat capacity ``c_p``.
