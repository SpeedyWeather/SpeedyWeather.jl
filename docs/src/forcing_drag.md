## Custom forcing and drag

The following example is a bit more concrete than the previous conceptual example,
but we try to add a few more details that are important, or you at least should
be aware of it. In this example we want to add a `StochasticStirring` forcing
as defined in [Vallis et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061%3C0264:AMASDM%3E2.0.CO;2)

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} &+ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}(\zeta + f)) =
S - r\zeta - \nu\nabla^{4}\zeta \\ 
S_{l, m}^i &= A(1-\exp(-2\tfrac{\Delta t}{\tau}))Q^i_{l, m} + \exp(-\tfrac{dt}{\tau})S_{l, m}^{i-1} \\
\end{aligned}
```

So there is a term `S` that is supposed to force the vorticity equation in the
[Barotropic vorticity model]. However, this term is also stochastically
evolving in time, meaning we have to store the previous time steps, ``i-1``,
in spectral space, because that's where the forcing is defined: for degree
``l`` and order ``m`` of the spherical harmonics. ``A`` is a real amplitude.
``\Delta t`` the time step of the model, ``\tau`` the decorrelation time scale
of the stochastic process. ``Q`` is for every spherical harmonic a complex random uniform
number in ``[-1, 1]`` in both its real and imaginary components. 
So we actually define our `StochasticStirring` forcing as follows and
will explain the details in second

```@example extend
using SpeedyWeather

@kwdef struct StochasticStirring{NF} <: SpeedyWeather.AbstractForcing

    # DIMENSIONS from SpectralGrid
    "Spectral resolution as max degree of spherical harmonics"
    trunc::Int

    "Number of latitude rings, used for latitudinal mask"
    nlat::Int


    # OPTIONS
    "Decorrelation time scale τ [days]"
    decorrelation_time::Second = Day(2)

    "Stirring strength A [1/s²]"
    strength::NF = 5e-11

    "Stirring latitude [˚N]"
    latitude::NF = 45

    "Stirring width [˚]"
    width::NF = 24


    # TO BE INITIALISED
    "Stochastic stirring term S"
    S::LowerTriangularMatrix{Complex{NF}} = zeros(LowerTriangularMatrix{Complex{NF}}, trunc+2, trunc+1)

    "a = A*sqrt(1 - exp(-2dt/τ)), the noise factor times the stirring strength [1/s²]"
    a::Base.RefValue{NF} = Ref(zero(NF))

    "b = exp(-dt/τ), the auto-regressive factor [1]"
    b::Base.RefValue{NF} = Ref(zero(NF))

    "Latitudinal mask, confined to mid-latitude storm track by default [1]"
    lat_mask::Vector{NF} = zeros(NF, nlat)
end
```

So, first the scalar parameters, are added as fields of type `NF` (you could harcode `Float64` too)
with some default values as suggested in the
[Vallis et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061%3C0264:AMASDM%3E2.0.CO;2) paper.
In order to be able to define the default values, we add the `@kwdef` macro
before the `struct` definition. Then we need the term `S` as coefficients of the spherical harmonics, which
is a `LowerTriangularMatrix`, however we want its elements to be of number format `NF`,
which is also the parametric type of `StochasticStirring{NF}`, this is done because it will
allow us to use multiple dispatch not just based on `StochasticStirring` but also based on the
number format. Neat. In order to allocate `S` with some default though we need to
know the size of the matrix, which is given by the spectral resolution `trunc`.
So in order to automatically allocate `S` based on the right size we add `trunc` as another
field, which does not have a default but will be initialised with the help of a `SpectralGrid`,
as explained later. So once we call `StochasticStirring{NF}(trunc=31)` then `S` will automatically
have the right size.

Then we also see in the definition of `S` that there are prefactors ``A(1-\exp(-2\tfrac{\Delta t}{\tau}))``
which depend on the forcing's parameters but also on the time step, which, at the time of the creation
of `StochasticStirring` we might not know about! And definitely do not want to hardcode in.
So to illustrate what you can do in this case we define two additional parameters `a, b` that
are just initialized as zero, but that will be precalculated in the `initialize!` function.
However, we decided to define our `struct` as _immutable_ (meaning you cannot change it after
creation unless its elements have mutable fields, like the elements in vectors). In order
to make it mutable, we could write `mutable struct` instead, or as outlined here use `RefValue`s.
Another option would be to just recalculate `a, b` in `forcing!` on every time step.
Depending on exactly what you would like to do, you can choose your way.
Anyway, we decide to include `a, b` as `RefValue`s so that we can always access the scalar 
underneath with `a[]` and `b[]` and also change it with `a[] = 1` etc.

Lastly, the [Vallis et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061%3C0264:AMASDM%3E2.0.CO;2)
paper also describes how the forcing is not supposed to be applied everywhere on the globe but only
over a range of latitudes, meaning we want to scale down certain latitudes with a factor approaching
zero. For this we want to define a latitudinal mask `lat_mask` that is a vector of length `nlat`,
the number of latitude rings. Similar to `S`, we want to allocate it with zeros (or any other
value for that matter), but then precompute this mask in the `initialize!` step. For this
we need to know `nlat` at creation time meaning we add this field similar as to how we added
`trunc`. This mask requires the parameters `latitude` (it's position) and a `width` which
are therefore also added to the definition of `StochasticStirring`.

## Custom forcing: generator function

Cool. Now you could create our new `StochasticStirring` forcing with `StochasticStirring{Float64}(trunc=31, nlat=48)`,
and the default values would be chosen as well as the correct size of the arrays `S` and `lat_mask` we need
and in double precision Float64. Furthermore, note that because `StochasticStirring{NF}` is parametric
on the number format `NF`, these arrays are also allocated with the correct number format that will
be used throughout model integration.

But in SpeedyWeather we typically use the [SpectralGrid](@ref) object to pass on the information of
the resolution (and number format) so we want a generator function like
```@example extend
function StochasticStirring(SG::SpectralGrid; kwargs...)
    (; trunc, nlat) = SG
    return StochasticStirring{SG.NF}(; trunc, nlat, kwargs...)
end
```
Which allows us to do
```@example extend
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=42, nlayers=1)
stochastic_stirring = StochasticStirring(spectral_grid, latitude=30, decorrelation_time=Day(5))
```
So the respective resolution parameters and the number format are just pulled from the `SpectralGrid`
as a first argument and the remaining parameters are just keyword arguments that one can change at creation.
This evolved as a SpeedyWeather convention: The first argument of the generating function to a
model component is a [SpectralGrid](@ref) and other keyword arguments specific to that component follow.

## Custom forcing: initialize

Now let us have a closer look at the details of the `initialize!` function, in our example we would
actually do
```@example extend
function SpeedyWeather.initialize!( forcing::StochasticStirring,
                                    model::AbstractModel)
    
    # precompute forcing strength, scale with radius^2 as is the vorticity equation
    (; radius) = model.spectral_grid
    A = radius^2 * forcing.strength
    
    # precompute noise and auto-regressive factor, packed in RefValue for mutability
    dt = model.time_stepping.Δt_sec
    τ = forcing.decorrelation_time.value        # in seconds
    forcing.a[] = A*sqrt(1 - exp(-2dt/τ))
    forcing.b[] = exp(-dt/τ)
    
    # precompute the latitudinal mask
    (; Grid, nlat_half) = model.spectral_grid
    latd = RingGrids.get_latd(Grid, nlat_half)
    
    for j in eachindex(forcing.lat_mask)
        # Gaussian centred at forcing.latitude of width forcing.width
        forcing.lat_mask[j] = exp(-(forcing.latitude-latd[j])^2/forcing.width^2*2)
    end

    return nothing
end
```
As we want to add a method for the `StochasticStirring` to the `initialize!` function from
within `SpeedyWeather` we add the `SpeedyWeather.` to add this method in the right
[Scope of variables](@ref). The `initialize!` function _must_ have that function signature,
instance of your new type `StochasticStirring` first, then the second argument a
`model` of type `AbstractModel` or, if your forcing (and in general component) _only makes
sense_ in a specific model, you could also write `model::Barotropic` for example,
to be more restrictive. Inside the `initialize!` method we are defining we can
use parameters from other components. For example, the definition of the `S` term
includes the time step ``\Delta t``, which should be pulled from the `model.time_stepping`.
We also pull the `Grid` and its resolution parameter `nlat_half` (see [Grids](@ref))
to get the latitudes with `get_latd` from the `RingGrids` module. Alternatively,
we could have used `model.geometry.latd` which is contains a bunch of similar arrays
describing the geometry of the grid we use and at its given resolution.

Note that `initialize!` is expected to be read and write on the `forcing` argument
(hence using Julia's `!`-notation) but read-only on the `model`,
except for `model.forcing` which points to the same object. You technically can
initialize or generally alter several model components in one, but that not advised
and can easily lead to unexpected behaviour because of multiple dispatch.

As a last note on `initialize!`, you can see that we scale the amplitude/strength `A`
with the radius squared, this is because the [Barotropic vorticity equation](@ref barotropic_vorticity_model)
are scaled that way, so we have to scale `S` too.

## Custom forcing: forcing! function

Now that we have defined how to create and initialize our new `StochasticStirring` forcing,
we need to define what it actually is supposed _to do_. For this SpeedyWeather will
call the `forcing!` function within a time step. However, this function is not yet
defined for our new `StochasticStirring` forcing. But if you define it as follows
then this will be called automatically with multiple dispatch.

```@example extend
function SpeedyWeather.forcing!(
    diagn::DiagnosticVariables,
    progn::PrognosticVariables,
    forcing::StochasticStirring,
    model::AbstractModel,
    lf::Integer,
)
    # function barrier only
    forcing!(diagn, forcing, model.spectral_transform)
end
```
The function signature (types and number of its arguments) has to be as outlined above.
The first argument has to be of type `DiagnosticVariables` as the diagnostic variables,
are the ones you want to change (likely the tendencies within) to apply a forcing.
But technically you can change anything else too, although the results may be unexpected.
The diagnostic variables contain the current model state in grid-point space and the
tendencies (in grid and spectral space). The second argument has to be of type
`PrognosticVariables` because, in general, the forcing may use (information from)
the prognostic variables in spectral space, which includes in `progn.clock.time` the current
time for time-dependent forcing. But all prognostic variables should be considered read-only.
The third argument has to be of the type of our new custom forcing, here `StochasticStirring`,
so that multiple dispatch calls the correct method of `forcing!`. The forth argument is of type
`AbstractModel`, so that the forcing can also make use of anything inside `model`, e.g.
`model.geometry` or `model.planet` etc. But you can be more restrictive to define a forcing only
for the `BarotropicModel` for example, use ``model::Barotropic`` in that case.
Or you could define two methods, one for `Barotropic` one for all other models with
`AbstractModel` (not `Barotropic` as a more specific method is prioritised with multiple
dispatch). The 5th argument is the leapfrog index `lf` which after the first time step will
be `lf=2` to denote that tendencies are evaluated at the current time not at the previous time
(how leapfrogging works). Unless you want to read the prognostic variables, for which
you need to know whether to read `lf=1` or `lf=2`, you can ignore this (but need to include
it as argument).

As you can see, for now not much is actually happening inside this function,
this is what is often called a function barrier, the only thing we do in here
is to unpack the model to the specific model components we actually need.
You can omit this function barrier and jump straight to the definition below,
but often this is done for performance and clarity reasons: `model` might have
abstract fields which the compiler cannot optimize for, but unpacking them
makes that possible. And it also tells you more clearly what a function depends on.
So we define the actual `forcing!` function that's then called as follows

```@example extend
function forcing!(
    diagn::DiagnosticVariables,
    forcing::StochasticStirring{NF},
    spectral_transform::SpectralTransform
) where NF
    
    # noise and auto-regressive factors
    a = forcing.a[]    # = sqrt(1 - exp(-2dt/τ))
    b = forcing.b[]    # = exp(-dt/τ)
    
    (; S) = forcing
    for lm in eachindex(S)
        # Barnes and Hartmann, 2011 Eq. 2
        Qi = 2rand(Complex{NF}) - (1 + im)   # ~ [-1, 1] in complex
        S[lm] = a*Qi + b*S[lm]
    end

    # to grid-point space
    S_grid = diagn.dynamics.a_grid  # use scratch array "a"
    transform!(S_grid, S, spectral_transform)
    
    # mask everything but mid-latitudes
    RingGrids._scale_lat!(S_grid, forcing.lat_mask)
    
    # back to spectral space
    (; vor_tend) = diagn.tendencies
    transform!(vor_tend, S_grid, spectral_transform)

    return nothing
end
```
The function signature can then just match to whatever we need. In our case
we have a forcing defined in spectral space which, however, is masked in
grid-point space. So we will need the `model.spectral_transform`.
You could recompute the `spectral_transform` object inside the function
but that is inefficient.

Now this is actually where we implement the equation we started from in
[Custom forcing and drag](@ref) simply by looping over the spherical
harmonics in `S` and updating its entries. Then we transform `S` into
grid-point space using the `a_grid` work array that is in `dynamics_variables`,
`b_grid` is another one you can use, so are `a, b` in spectral space.
However, these are really work arrays, meaning you should expect them
to be overwritten momentarily once the function concludes and no information
will remain. Equivalently, these arrays may have an undefined state 
prior to the `forcing!` call. We then use the `_scale_lat!` function
from `RingGrids` which takes every element in the latitude mask `lat_mask`
and multiplies it with every grid-point on the respective latitude ring.

Now for the last lines we have to know the order in which different terms
are written into the tendencies for vorticity, `diagn.tendencies.vor_tend`.
In SpeedyWeather, the `forcing!` comes first, then the `drag!` (see [Custom drag](@ref))
then the curl of the vorticity flux (the vorticity advection).
This means we can transform `S_grid` directly back into `vor_tend`
without overwriting other terms which, in fact, will be added to this
array afterwards. In general, you can also force the momentum equations
in grid-point space by writing into `u_tend_grid` and `v_tend_grid`.

## Custom forcing: model construction

Now that we have defined a new forcing, as well as how to initialize it and what
it is supposed to execute on every time step, we also want to use it.
We generally follow other [Examples](@ref Examples), start with the [SpectralGrid](@ref)
and use that to get an instance of `StochasticStirring`.
This calls the generator function from [Custom forcing: generator function](@ref).
Here we want to stir vorticity not at the default latitude of 45N, but on the southern
hemisphere to illustrate how to pass on non-default parameters. We explicitly set the
`initial_conditions` to rest and pass them as well as `forcing=stochastic_stirring`
on to the `BarotropicModel` constructor. That's it! This is really the beauty of our
modular interface that you can create instances of individual model components
and just put them together as you like, and as long as you follow some rules.

```@example extend
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=85, nlayers=1)
stochastic_stirring = StochasticStirring(spectral_grid, latitude=-45)
initial_conditions = StartFromRest()
model = BarotropicModel(spectral_grid; initial_conditions, forcing=stochastic_stirring)
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation)

# visualisation
using CairoMakie
vor = simulation.diagnostic_variables.grid.vor_grid[:, 1]
heatmap(vor, title="Stochastically stirred vorticity")
save("stochastic_stirring.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```
![Stochastic stirring](stochastic_stirring.png)

Yay! As you can see the vorticity does something funky on the southern hemisphere
but not on the northern, as we do not force there. Awesome! Adding new
components other than forcing works surprisingly similar. We briefly discuss
how to add a custom drag to illustrate the differences but there are not really
many.

## Custom drag

From the barotropic vorticity equation in [Custom forcing and drag](@ref) we omitted
the drag term ``-r\zeta`` which however can be defined in a strikingly similar way.
This section is just to outline some differences.

SpeedyWeather defines `AbstractForcing` and `AbstractDrag`, both are only conceptual
supertypes, and in fact you could define a forcing as a subtype of `AbstractDrag`
and vice versa. So for a drag, most straight-forwardly you would do
```@example extend
struct MyDrag <: SpeedyWeather.AbstractDrag
    # parameters and arrays
end
```
then define the `initialize!` function as before, but extend the method `drag!`
instead of `forcing!`. The only detail that is important to know is that
`forcing!` is called first, then `drag!` and then the other tendencies.
So if you write into `vor_tend` like so `vor_tend[1] = 1`, you will overwrite
the previous tendency. For the forcing that does not matter as it is the first
one to be called, but for the drag you will want to do `vor_tend[1] += 1`
instead to accumulate the tendency. Otherwise you would undo the forcing term!
Note that this conflict would be avoided if the forcing writes into
`vor_tend` but the drag writes into `u_tend_grid`.

In general, these are the fields you can write into for new terms

- `vor_tend` in spectral space
- `div_tend` in spectral space (shallow water only)
- `pres_tend` in spectral space (shallow water only)
- `u_tend_grid` in grid-point space
- `v_tend_grid` in grid-point space

These space restrictions exist because of the way how SpeedyWeather transforms
between spaces to obtain tendencies.
