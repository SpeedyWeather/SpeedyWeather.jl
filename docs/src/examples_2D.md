# [Examples 2D](@id Examples)

The following is a collection of example model setups, starting with an easy setup
of the [Barotropic vorticity equation](@ref barotropic_vorticity_model) and
continuing with the [shallow water model](@ref shallow_water_model).

See also [Examples 3D](@ref) for examples with the primitive equation models.

## 2D turbulence on a non-rotating sphere

!!! info "Setup script to copy and paste"
    ```julia
    using SpeedyWeather
    spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=63, nlev=1)
    still_earth = Earth(spectral_grid, rotation=0)
    initial_conditions = StartWithRandomVorticity()
    model = BarotropicModel(; spectral_grid, initial_conditions, planet=still_earth)
    simulation = initialize!(model)
    run!(simulation, period=Day(20))
    ```

We want to use the barotropic model to simulate some free-decaying 2D turbulence
on the sphere without rotation. We start by defining the `SpectralGrid` object.
To have a resolution of about 200km, we choose a spectral resolution of
T63 (see [Available horizontal resolutions](@ref)) and `nlev=1` vertical levels.
The `SpectralGrid` object will provide us with some more information
```@example barotropic_setup
using SpeedyWeather
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=63, nlev=1)
```
Next step we create a planet that's like Earth but not rotating. As a convention,
we always pass on the spectral grid object as the first argument to every other
model component we create.
```@example barotropic_setup
still_earth = Earth(spectral_grid, rotation=0)
```
There are other options to create a planet but they are irrelevant for the
barotropic vorticity equations. We also want to specify the initial conditions,
randomly distributed vorticity is already defined
```@example barotropic_setup
using Random # hide
Random.seed!(1234) # hide
initial_conditions = StartWithRandomVorticity()
```
By default, the power of vorticity is spectrally distributed with ``k^{-3}``, ``k`` being the
horizontal wavenumber, and the amplitude is ``10^{-5}\text{s}^{-1}``.

Now we want to construct a `BarotropicModel`
with these
```@example barotropic_setup
model = BarotropicModel(; spectral_grid, initial_conditions, planet=still_earth)
nothing # hide
```
The `model` contains all the parameters, but isn't initialized yet, which we can do
with and then run it. The `run!` command will always return the prognostic variables, which, by default, are 
plotted for surface relative vorticity with a unicode plot. The resolution of the plot
is not necessarily representative but it lets us have a quick look at the result
```@example barotropic_setup
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation, period=Day(20))
```

Woohoo! Something is moving! You could pick up where this simulation stopped by simply
doing `run!(simulation, period=Day(50))` again. We didn't store any output, which
you can do by `run!(simulation, output=true)`, which will switch on NetCDF output
with default settings. More options on output in [NetCDF output](@ref).

## Shallow water with mountains

!!! info "Setup script to copy and past"
    ```julia
    using SpeedyWeather
    spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=63, nlev=1)
    orography = NoOrography(spectral_grid)
    initial_conditions = ZonalJet()
    model = ShallowWaterModel(; spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions)
    simulation = initialize!(model)
    run!(simulation, period=Day(6))
    ```

As a second example, let's investigate the Galewsky et al.[^G04] test case for the shallow
water equations with and without mountains. As the shallow water system has also only
one level, we can reuse the `SpectralGrid` from Example 1.
```@example galewsky_setup
using SpeedyWeather
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=63, nlev=1)
```
Now as a first simulation, we want to disable any orography, so we create a `NoOrography`
```@example galewsky_setup
orography = NoOrography(spectral_grid)
```
Although the orography is zero, you have to pass on `spectral_grid` so that it can
still initialize zero-arrays of the correct size and element type. Awesome.
This time the initial conditions should be set the the Galewsky et al.[^G04] zonal
jet, which is already defined as
```@example galewsky_setup
initial_conditions = ZonalJet()
```
The jet sits at 45ËšN with a maximum velocity of 80m/s and a perturbation as described in their paper.
Now we construct a model, but this time a `ShallowWaterModel`
```@example galewsky_setup
model = ShallowWaterModel(; spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions)
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation, period=Day(6))
```
Oh yeah. That looks like the wobbly jet in their paper. Let's run it again for another 6 days
but this time also store [NetCDF output](@ref).
```@example galewsky_setup
run!(simulation, period=Day(6), output=true)
```
The progress bar tells us that the simulation run got the identification "0001"
(which just counts up, so yours might be higher), meaning that
data is stored in the folder `/run_0001`. In general we can check this also via
```@example galewsky_setup
id = model.output.id
```
So let's plot that data properly (and not just using UnicodePlots.jl). `$id` in the following just means
that the string is interpolated to `run_0001` if this is the first unnamed run in your folder.
```@example galewsky_setup
using NCDatasets
ds = NCDataset("run_$id/output.nc")
ds["vor"]
```
Vorticity `vor` is stored as a lon x lat x vert x time array, we may want to look at the first time step,
which is the end of the previous simulation (time = 6days) which we didn't store output for.
```@example galewsky_setup
t = 1
vor = Matrix{Float32}(ds["vor"][:, :, 1, t]) # convert from Matrix{Union{Missing, Float32}} to Matrix{Float32}
lat = ds["lat"][:]
lon = ds["lon"][:]

using CairoMakie
heatmap(lon, lat, vor)
save("galewsky0.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```
![Galewsky jet](galewsky0.png)

You see that in comparison the unicode plot heavily coarse-grains the simulation, well it's unicode after all!
Here, we have unpacked the netCDF file using [NCDatasets.jl](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl)
and then plotted via `heatmap(lon, lat, vor)`. While you can do that to give you more control
on the plotting, SpeedyWeather.jl also defines an extension for Makie.jl, see [Extensions](@ref).
Because if our matrix `vor` here was an `AbstractGrid` (see [RingGrids](@ref)) then all
its geographic information (which grid point is where) would directly be encoded in the type.
From the netCDF file you need to use the longitude and latitude dimensions.

So we can also just do
```@example galewsky_setup
vor_grid = FullGaussianGrid(vor)

using CairoMakie    # this will load the extension so that Makie can plot grids directly
heatmap(vor_grid, title="Relative vorticity [1/s]")
save("galewsky1.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```
![Galewsky jet pyplot1](galewsky1.png)

Note that here you need to know which grid the data comes on (an error is thrown if `FullGaussianGrid(vor)`
is not size compatible). By default the output will be on the FullGaussianGrid, but if you
play around with other grids, you'd need to change this here,
see [NetCDF output on other grids](@ref output_grid).

We did want to showcase the usage of [NetCDF output](@ref) here, but from now on
we will use `heatmap` to plot data on our grids directly, without storing output first.
So for our current simulation, that means at time = 12 days, vorticity on the grid
is stored in the diagnostic variables and can be visualised with

```@example galewsky_setup
vor = simulation.diagnostic_variables.layers[1].grid_variables.vor_grid
heatmap(vor, title="Relative vorticity [1/s]")
save("galewsky2.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```
![Galewsky jet](galewsky2.png)

The jet broke up into many small eddies, but the turbulence is still confined to the northern hemisphere, cool!
How this may change when we add mountains (we had `NoOrography` above!), say Earth's orography, you may ask?
Let's try it out! We create an `EarthOrography` struct like so

```@example galewsky_setup
orography = EarthOrography(spectral_grid)
```

It will read the orography from file as shown (only at `initialize!(model)`), and there are some smoothing
options too, but let's not change them. Same as before, create a model, initialize into a simulation, run.
This time directly for 12 days so that we can compare with the last plot

```@example galewsky_setup
model = ShallowWaterModel(; spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions)
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation, period=Day(12), output=true)
```

This time the run got a new run id, which you see in the progress bar, but can again always check
after the `run!` call (the automatic run id is only determined just before the main time loop starts)
with `model.output.id`, but otherwise we do as before.
```@example galewsky_setup
id = model.output.id
```

```@example galewsky_setup
ds = NCDataset("run_$id/output.nc")
```

You could plot the [NetCDF output](@ref) now as before, but we'll be plotting directly
from the current state of the `simulation`

```@example galewsky_setup
vor = simulation.diagnostic_variables.layers[1].grid_variables.vor_grid
heatmap(vor, title="Relative vorticity [1/s]")
save("galewsky3.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```
![Galewsky jet](galewsky3.png)

Interesting! The initial conditions have zero velocity in the southern hemisphere, but still, one can see
some imprint of the orography on vorticity. You can spot the coastline of Antarctica; the Andes and
Greenland are somewhat visible too. Mountains also completely changed the flow after 12 days,
probably not surprising!

## Polar jet streams in shallow water

Setup script to copy and paste:
```@example jet_stream_setup
using SpeedyWeather
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=63, nlev=1)

forcing = JetStreamForcing(spectral_grid, latitude=60)
drag = QuadraticDrag(spectral_grid)

model = ShallowWaterModel(; spectral_grid, drag, forcing)
simulation = initialize!(model)
model.feedback.verbose = false # hide
run!(simulation, period=Day(40))
nothing # hide
```

We want to simulate polar jet streams in the shallow water model. We add a `JetStreamForcing`
that adds momentum at 60ËšN to inject kinetic energy into the model. This energy needs to be removed
(the [diffusion](@ref diffusion) is likely not sufficient) through a drag, we have implemented
a `QuadraticDrag` and use the default drag coefficient. Then visualize zonal wind after
40 days with

```@example jet_stream_setup
using CairoMakie

u = simulation.diagnostic_variables.layers[1].grid_variables.u_grid
heatmap(u, title="Zonal wind [m/s]")
save("polar_jets.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```

## Gravity waves on the sphere

Setup script to copy and paste:
```@example gravity_wave_setup
using Random # hide
Random.seed!(1234) # hide
using SpeedyWeather
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=127, nlev=1)

# model components
time_stepping = SpeedyWeather.Leapfrog(spectral_grid, Î”t_at_T31=Minute(30))
implicit = SpeedyWeather.ImplicitShallowWater(spectral_grid, Î±=0.5)
orography = EarthOrography(spectral_grid, smoothing=false)
initial_conditions = SpeedyWeather.RandomWaves()

# construct, initialize, run
model = ShallowWaterModel(; spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions, implicit, time_stepping)
simulation = initialize!(model)
model.feedback.verbose = false # hide
run!(simulation, period=Day(2))
nothing # hide
```

How are gravity waves propagating around the globe? We want to use the shallow water model
to start with some random perturbations of the interface displacement (the "sea surface height")
but zero velocity and let them propagate around the globe. We set the ``\alpha`` parameter
of the [semi-implicit time integration](@ref implicit_swm) to ``0.5`` to have a centred
implicit scheme which dampens the gravity waves less than a backward implicit scheme would do.
But we also want to keep orography, and particularly no smoothing on it, to have the orography
as rough as possible. The initial conditions are set to `RandomWaves` which set the spherical
harmonic coefficients of ``\eta`` to between given wavenumbers to some random values
```@example gravity_wave_setup
SpeedyWeather.RandomWaves()
```
so that the amplitude `A` is as desired, here 2000m. Our layer thickness in meters is by default
```@example gravity_wave_setup
model.atmosphere.layer_thickness
```
so those waves are with an amplitude of 2000m quite strong.
But the semi-implicit time integration can handle that even with fairly large time steps of
```@example gravity_wave_setup
model.time_stepping.Î”t_sec
```
seconds. Note that the gravity wave speed here is ``\sqrt{gH}`` so almost 300m/s,
given the speed of gravity waves we don't have to integrate for long.
Visualise the dynamic layer thickness ``h = \eta + H + H_b`` 
(interface displacement ``\eta``, layer thickness at rest ``H`` and orography ``H_b``)
with

```@example gravity_wave_setup
using CairoMakie

H = model.atmosphere.layer_thickness
Hb = model.orography.orography
Î· = simulation.diagnostic_variables.surface.pres_grid
h = @. Î· + H - Hb   # @. to broadcast grid + scalar - grid

heatmap(h, title="Dynamic layer thickness h", colormap=:oslo)
save("gravity_waves.png", ans) # hide
nothing # hide
```

Can you spot the Himalayas or the Andes?
