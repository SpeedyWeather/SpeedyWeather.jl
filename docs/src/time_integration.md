# [Time integration](@id leapfrog)

SpeedyWeather.jl is based on the [Leapfrog time integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration]),
which, for relative vorticity ``\zeta``, is
in its simplest form
```math
\frac{\zeta_{i+1} - \zeta_{i-1}}{2\Delta t} = RHS(\zeta_i),
```
meaning we step from the previous time step ``i-1``, leapfrogging over the current time step``i``
to the next time step ``i+1`` by evaluating the tendencies on the right-hand side ``RHS``
at the current time step ``i``. The time stepping is done in spectral space.
Once the right-hand side ``RHS`` is evaluated, leapfrogging is a linear operation, meaning
that its simply applied to every spectral coefficient ``\zeta_{lm}`` as one would evaluate
it on every grid point in grid-point models.

For the Leapfrog time integration two time steps of the prognostic variables have to be stored,
``i-1`` and ``i``. Time step ``i`` is used to evaluate the tendencies which are then added
to ``i-1`` in a step that also swaps the indices for the next time step ``i \to i-1`` and ``i+1 \to i``,
so that no additional memory than two time steps have to be stored at the same time.

## Leapfrog initialisation

The Leapfrog time integration has to be initialized with an Euler forward step in order
to have a second time step ``i+1`` available when starting from ``i`` to actually leapfrog over.
SpeedyWeather.jl therefore does two initial time steps that are different from
the leapfrog time steps that follow and that have been described above.

1) an Euler forward step with ``\Delta t/2``, then
2) one leapfrog time step with ``\Delta t``, then
3) leapfrog with ``2 \Delta t`` till the end

This is particularly done in a way that after 2. we have ``t=0`` at ``i-1`` and ``t=\Delta t`` at ``i``
available so that 3. can start the leapfrogging without any offset from the intuitive spacing
``0, \Delta  t, 2\Delta t, 3\Delta t, ...``. The following schematic can be useful

|                    | time at step ``i-1`` | time at step ``i`` | time step at ``i+1`` |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Initial conditions | ``t = 0``            |                    |                      |
| 1: Euler           | (T) ``\quad t = 0``  |  ``t=\Delta t/2``  |                      |
| 2: Leapfrog with ``\Delta t``|``t = 0``|(T) ``\quad t = \Delta t/2``| ``t = \Delta t``|
| 3 to ``n``: Leapfrog with ``2\Delta t``|``t-\Delta t``|(T) ``\qquad \quad \quad t``| ``t+\Delta t`` |

The time step that is used to evaluate the tendencies is denoted with (T).
It is always the time step furthest in time that is available.


## Robert-Asselin and Williams filter

The standard leapfrog time integration is often combined with a Robert-Asselin filter[^Robert66][^Asselin72]
to dampen a computational mode. The idea is to start with a standard leapfrog step to obtain
the next time step ``i+1`` but then to correct the current time step ``i`` by applying a filter
which dampens the computational mode. The filter looks like a discrete Laplacian in time
with a ``(1, -2, 1)`` stencil, and so, maybe unsurprisingly, is efficient to filter out
a "grid-scale oscillation" in time, aka the computational mode. Let ``v`` be the unfiltered
variable and ``u`` be the filtered variable, ``F`` the right-hand side tendency,
then the standard leapfrog step is
```math
v_{i+1} = u_{i-1} + 2\Delta tF(v_i)
```
Meaning we start with a filtered variable ``u`` at the previous time step ``i-1``, evaluate
the tendency ``F(v_i)`` based on the current time step ``i`` to obtain an
unfiltered next time step ``v_{i+1}``. We then filter the current time step ``i``
(which will become ``i-1`` on the next iteration)
```math
u_i = v_i + \frac{\nu}{2}(v_{i+1} - 2v_i + u_{i-1})
```
by adding a discrete Laplacian with coefficient ``\tfrac{\nu}{2}`` to it, evaluated
from the available filtered and unfiltered time steps centred around ``i``:
``v_{i-1}`` is not available anymore because it was overwritten by the filtering
at the previous iteration, ``v_i, v_{i+1}`` are not filtered yet when applying
the Laplacian. The filter parameter ``\nu`` is typically chosen between 0.01-0.2,
with stronger filtering for higher values.

Williams[^Williams2009] then proposed an additional filter step to regain accuracy
that is otherwise lost with a strong Robert-Asselin filter[^Amezcua2011][^Williams2011].
Now let ``w`` be unfiltered, ``v`` be once filtered, and ``u`` twice filtered, then
```math
\begin{aligned}
w_{i+1} &= u_{i-1} + 2\Delta tF(v_i) \\
u_i &= v_i + \frac{\nu\alpha}{2}(w_{i+1} - 2v_i + u_{i-1}) \\
v_{i+1} &= w_{i+1} - \frac{\nu(1-\alpha)}{2}(w_{i+1} - 2v_i + u_{i-1})
\end{aligned}
```
with the Williams filter parameter ``\alpha \in [0.5, 1]``. For ``\alpha=1``
we're back with the Robert-Asselin filter (the first two lines).

The Laplacian in the parentheses is often called a *displacement*,
meaning that the filtered value is displaced (or corrected) in the direction
of the two surrounding time steps. The Williams filter now also applies
the same displacement, but in the opposite direction to the next time
step ``i+1`` as a correction step (line 3 above) for a once-filtered
value ``v_{i+1}`` which will then be twice-filtered by the Robert-Asselin
filter on the next iteration. For more details see the referenced publications.

The initial Euler step (see [Time integration](@ref leapfrog), Table) is not filtered.
Both the the Robert-Asselin and Williams filter are then switched on for all
following leapfrog time steps.

## Leapfrog options

The leapfrog time integration is controlled by creating a custom `Leapfrog`
component and passing it on to the model constructor

```@example leapfrog
using SpeedyWeather
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid()
time_stepping = Leapfrog(spectral_grid, start_with_euler=true)
```

and with `?Leapfrog` you see a summary of the fields, only manually change those marked `[OPTION]`.
```@example leapfrog
@doc Leapfrog
```

we will discuss some options in the following.

## Change the time step

SpeedyWeather chooses the time step automatically based on the resolution.
A default time step of

```@example leapfrog
time_stepping.Δt_at_T31
```

is used at T31 (`trunc=31`) spectral resolution (see [Available horizontal resolutions](@ref))
which is then (almost) linearly scaled to higher (or lower) resolution. Creating a simulation
at twice the resolution (T63) will approximatel half the time step (20min if T31 runs at 40min).
This is such that in most cases the user does need to know what time step is stable. But if
you want a shorter time step the easiest is to choose `Δt_at_T31` (write `\Delta` then hit tab,
works in the Julia REPL and other interfaces) relative to its default. If you half that time step
you'll half the time step for all resolutions. The other "timesteps" in `time_stepping` are
explained in the docstring (`?Leapfrog`). Note that internally SpeedyWeather uses a time step
scaled by the radius, so `time_stepping.Δt` will be in units of meter times second. 

You can also choose the timestep manually with

```@example leapfrog
set!(time_stepping, Δt=Minute(10))
```

which you can do before `initialize!(model)` or after -- it will change the other time step information
consistently, as shown here. You can provide any `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, but note that there is a
stability limit above which your simulation quickly blows up.

## Adjust with output

By default the time step is (slightly) adjusted to match the [Output frequency](@ref).
See that section for more information.

## Restart with Leapfrog

As a 2-step scheme, leapfrog time stepping has to be initialised with another scheme (e.g. Euler forward)
to have information for the 2nd step if not otherwise known, see [Leapfrog initialisation](@ref).
This is done by default as `time_stepping.start_with_euler` is `true`. If you `StartFromFile`
as initial conditions then you may want to switch this to false. 

SpeedyWeather also allows the user to use several `run!(simulation)` calls after another to continue
a simulation, possibly after some modification by the user. These subsequent `run!` calls use
leapfrog to continue the time integration (as the 2nd step is available) by default,
but this is determined by `time_stepping.continue_with_leapfrog` and can be deactivated.

Internally, `time_stepping.first_step_euler` will switch from `true` to `false` during an integration
if `continue_with_leapfrog==true` to store the information that this simulation was already run
previously. Don't change `first_step_euler` directly, hence it's marked as `[DERIVED]` in the
docstring.

## Passing `time_stepping` to the model constructor

Here we just called our time stepping scheme `time_stepping` but this needs to be passed on to the model constructor,
e.g. for the `PrimitiveDryModel`

```@example leapfrog
model = PrimitiveDryModel(spectral_grid; time_stepping)
```

where `;` matches the `time_stepping` keyword argument by name. If you name `leapfrog = Leapfrog(spectral_grid)` then you
would need to change this to `time_stepping=leapfrog` in the function call arguments.
