# Full Reactant compatibility incl. the primitive equation models

> Status: **in progress**. All models run on Reactant (CPU backend), CPU-vs-Reactant correctness tests pass; awaiting review, GPU (Reactant+CUDA) untested.

Date of initial draft: 2026-10-12

Base revision: c0acb2ca (main at 7c1beecb incl. #1302 merged into `mg/new-reactant`)

## Originating prompt

> We want to achieve full compatability with Reactant. Reactant was updated just a few hours ago to
> be able to deal with complex valued kernels. This was the one feature we were missing. We already
> started a lot of this work on `mg/reactant-primitive` / #985. However this branch is stale and out
> of date now. We want to start in a fresh branch but take a lot of the changes from
> `mg/reactant-primitive`. Start by taking over the `test/reactant` changes that add correctness

## Revision log

> I just merged a fix for Reactant MatrixSpectralTransform into `main`. Merge that into this branch
> as well and take note #1302

Merged `main` (squash merge of #1302, identical to the already merged branch).

> in case upstream changes in Reactant are advisable, do them first here in the Reactant extension
> and mark them with #TODO: move upstream to Reactant

Fixes that belong into Reactant are in our Reactant extensions, marked `# TODO: move upstream to Reactant`.

## Problem description

`mg/reactant-primitive` (#985) got the primitive equation models close to running with Reactant but
diverged from `main` (300 commits, ~80 files). Reactant v0.2.292 now supports complex numbers in
kernels (Reactant.jl#3438), the last missing feature. The goal is to run every model on Reactant
with results matching the CPU.

## Background

- Reactant compiles `time_step!(simulation)` once (`@compile`) and calls it every time step, see
  `SpeedyWeatherReactantExt.time_stepping!`. Everything inside is traced: no data-dependent control
  flow, no transfers to the CPU, no scalar indexing. Numbers in the `Clock` are traced (concrete
  Reactant numbers), other numbers in the model are compile-time constants.
- Outside of `@compile` (`initialize!`), Reactant arrays are concrete, operations on them are
  compiled on the fly (KernelAbstractions kernels, broadcasting) or wrapped in `@maybe_jit`.
- KernelAbstractions kernels are lowered natively on the CPU/CUDA backends (not raised), so
  control flow inside kernels is fine.

## Summary of changes

From `mg/reactant-primitive`, only the changes required on top of `main` were taken over. Purely
"more parametric" changes (#1041, `Bool`/`Int`/`Second` fields as type parameters) were dropped as
plain numbers are not traced by `@compile`.

Model and numerics (all architectures)
- `Geometry`, `SigmaCoordinates`, `SigmaPressureCoordinates`: separate type parameters for vectors
  of different length (Reactant's kernel arrays carry their size as a type parameter).
- `ImplicitPrimitiveEquation`: new `initialize_traceable!` (broadcasting + Gauss-Jordan kernel)
  used for `ReactantDevice`; `Δt` is a `scalar_ref` (traced on Reactant). On Reactant
  `reinitialize!` recomputes the operators every step from a temperature profile that is only
  updated if the time step changed (no branching), equivalent to `main`'s behaviour.
- Leapfrog: the step `lf` is selected inside the kernel instead of a view with a traced index.
- Time step scaling without `oftype` (traceable), `secondofday` for any `AbstractDateTime`,
  zenith functions accept `Dates.AbstractDateTime`.
- `AbstractCPU` dispatch instead of `CPU`/`GPU` (geopotential, vertical integration),
  `set_scalar!` (SpeedyWeatherInternals) for single-element writes.
- `inv(x)` → `1 / x` in kernels (Reactant.jl#2560, Reactant+CUDA only).
- Logical indexing replaced by broadcasting (ocean, land), `@maybe_jit interpolate!` for boundary
  conditions, land-sea mask `mask!` for array masks, `extrema` → `minimum`/`maximum` (Reactant.jl#2387).
- RingGrids interpolation: no `undef` allocations, no reshape of matrices (`flatten_layers`),
  generic `average_on_poles` returning `1 × nlayers` matrices (no `vec`).

Reactant extensions
- `SpeedyWeatherReactantExt`: output and feedback (progress meter) between compiled steps
  (`do_output!` returns false, `progress!` returns inside `@compile`), `Feedback` not traced
  (its IO buffers can't be), `reinitialize!` for the implicit solver, `scalar_ref`.
- `RingGridsReactantExt`: `FieldReactantStyle` broadcasting (out-of-place broadcasts return
  fields), bounds checks, branchless ring search, `update_locator!` without safety checks.
- `LowerTriangularArraysReactantExt`: fix `BroadcastStyle` for the 5-parameter type.
- Upstream candidates (`# TODO: move upstream to Reactant`): broadcasting into views of concrete
  arrays (silently wrong results otherwise), `Dates.year` for traced days.

## Testing and verification

- `SpeedyWeather/test/reactant`: CPU-vs-Reactant correctness (tendencies after one step,
  prognostic and grid variables after 100 steps following a 10-day spin-up) for
  `BarotropicModel`, `ShallowWaterModel`, `PrimitiveDryModel`, `PrimitiveWetModel`
  (constant longwave transmissivity, no convection to avoid chaotic amplification), NetCDF and
  Zarr output, `MatrixSpectralTransform` outside of compilation, `@maybe_jit`.
- Default models (incl. Betts-Miller convection, Frierson longwave, default feedback with progress
  meter) run without NaNs; one-step tendencies agree to ~1e-4 (norm-relative) with convection active.
- CPU test suites of SpeedyWeatherInternals, LowerTriangularArrays, RingGrids, SpeedyTransforms pass.
- New unit tests: `initialize_traceable!` vs `initialize!`, `secondofday`, `set_scalar!`,
  no-op conversions of `Field`/`LowerTriangularArray`.

## Known limitations

- Reactant on GPU (CUDA) is not tested in this PR, `SpeedyWeather/test/GPU/reactant.jl` is still
  not included in the GPU test suite.
- Particles are not supported on Reactant.
- The prescribed seasonal climatologies (e.g. `SeasonalOceanClimatology`) are untested inside
  the compiled time step.

## Future work

- Move the `# TODO: move upstream to Reactant` fixes into Reactant, remove the `inv` and `extrema`
  workarounds once Reactant.jl#2560 and #2387 are fixed.
- Re-enable `@trace` for the time loop (checkpointing) in `time_stepping!`.
- Tighten the tolerances of the correctness tests, differences are orders of magnitude smaller
  than the current tolerances.
